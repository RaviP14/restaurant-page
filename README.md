## Restaurant Page Project ##

I have used **JavaScript** to dynamically generate the contents of each page of the website. This was done using **DOM manipulation**.

The **live preview** of the project is available <a href="https://ravip14.github.io/restaurant-page/">here</a>.

### Overview ###

- There are three restaurant pages **generated using JavaScript**.
- The Menu page includes **interactive** dishes.
- Dishes were created using the `class` constructor.
- Navigation has **active** feature.
- Project has been bundled with **Webpack**.
